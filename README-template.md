### What I learned

I learnt how create variables and use them during the style process and also learnt how to apply external fonts. I also learned media query.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Young+Serif&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

```css
:root{
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Stone100: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
    --Stone150: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
    --Stone600: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
    --Stone900: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
    --Brown800: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    --Rose800: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
    --Rose50: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
}


### Continued development

- Css properties(measurements especially)
- Accessing html elements during styling
- Media Query

### Useful resources

- [TraversyMedia](https://www.youtube.com) - This helped me on how to structure a webpage using semantic and non-semantic tags, creating easy access to html elements during the styling process
